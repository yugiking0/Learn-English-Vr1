### Obsessive Behavior


PARENTS DENY PROBABLE CAUSE OF SON'S OBSESSIVE BEHAVIOR

DEAR ABBY:

My nephew, "Vincent," is 16 and has had problems with obsessive handwashing for years. I have enough professional experience to strongly suspect that he suffers from obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).

My brother and his wife refuse to believe their child has a problem and will not take him to get help. My nephew's hands are chafed and raw, and his parents reprimand him for this behavior when he really needs professional help.

His mother is the biggest problem. She nixes all issues that suggest a problem, and my brother will not stand up to her. What can I do?
