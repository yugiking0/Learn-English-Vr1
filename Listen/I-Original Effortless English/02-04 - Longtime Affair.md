### Longtime Affair

LONGTIME AFFAIR APPEARS SET TO LAST FOR LONG TIME TO COME

DEAR ABBY:

I'm married; he's married. We're in love and have been for eight years. We've tried breaking it off several times over the years, but a force bigger than both of us keeps bringing us back together.

I never believed in soulmates or true love until we met. Our love is deep and unconditional; our roots are intertwined. It's a shame that it happened late in life, but it happened nonetheless. He treats me like a queen.

Neither of us is leaving our spouses or family. We are both in our 50s and sometimes act like we're in our 20s. It's magical!

Is it wrong? Do we go on until something changes? Do we try for the 100th time to break away? An affair, no matter how you slice it, will never be accepted in the eyes of traditional society, so it will be perceived as unacceptable. What's your opinion?
