### Lost Custody

YOUNG MOTHER IS FRIGHTENED BY THREAT OF LOST CUSTODY

DEAR ABBY:

I am 22 years old and have been married 17 months. "Derek" and I have a 23-month-old son. Derek hasn't worked for about a year and refuses to help support our family. He also belittles me whenever he talks to me. I am not happy in this marriage, but I am not sure what to do about it.

On our honeymoon, Derek told me if I ever divorced him that he'd make sure he would get custody of our son. And his mom already said that she would tell the judge that I was an unfit mother.

My son is my world, Abby. He doesn't even let his daddy hold him, so I know he wouldn't be better off with Derek. But because I am on disability, I don't know if I have a good chance of getting custody if I leave. I don't feel Derek loves me or my son.

What should I do? Stick it out with my husband or take the chance of losing my son?
